# End-to-End Twitter Stream Processing Application

Through the use of Apache Storm, Y, and Z, this application captures and stores all text contained in tweets while the listener is running. Two serving layer applications are available to analyze total traffic, data on specific words, or data on occurrence ranges.

TODO 
Documentation covering the overall idea, architecture, document structure, dependencies and usage included in Architecture.pdf.

TODO
Screenshots demonstrating end-to-end execution of the application are available in the screenshots directory.

TODO - Plot.png: a bar chart, generated however you prefer, that shows the top 20 words in your Twitter stream.
