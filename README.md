# End-to-End Twitter Stream Processing Application

Through the use of Apache Storm, Amazon EC2, Python, Twitter API, Streamparse, Postgres, PsycoPG, and Tweepy this application captures and stores all text contained in tweets while the listener is running. Two serving layer applications are available to analyze total traffic, data on specific words, or data on occurrence ranges.

TODO
Screenshots demonstrating end-to-end execution of the application are available in the screenshots directory.

TODO - Plot.png: a bar chart, generated however you prefer, that shows the top 20 words in your Twitter stream.
